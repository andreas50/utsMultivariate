# utsMult

S3 classes ("uts_vector" and "uts_matrix") for multivariate unevenly spaced time series.

R users familiar with vectors and matrices should find it straightforward to work with the corresponding time series objects, because the usage of many functions (such as [, [[, length, etc.) is completely analogous.
