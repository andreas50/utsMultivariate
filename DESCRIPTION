Description: S3 classes ("uts_vector" and "uts_matrix") for multivariate
    unevenly spaced time series. R users familiar with vectors and matrices
    should find it straightforward to work with the corresponding time series
    objects, because the usage of many functions (such as [, [[, length, etc.)
    is completely analogous.
