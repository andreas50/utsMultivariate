Description: S3 classes for multivariate unevenly spaced time series. R users
    familiar with vectors, matrices, and data frames should find it
    straightforward to work with the corresponding time series objects, because
    the usage of many functions (such as [, [[, length, etc.) is completely
    analogous.
